"""
Tier 1 - Feature 101: per-touch enrollment burst reset (Ticket 101/103).

Verifies without hardware (hermetic static & structural validation):
(a) the enroll-continue branch of on_read_img resets the burst AFTER the
    deliver tail consumed the winner and BEFORE fpi_ssm_next_state, so each
    of the 12 enrollment touches banks its own 4-frame burst. Pre-fix,
    frame_count kept climbing past GOODIX_5E0A_FRAMES_PER_TOUCH (journal:
    "frame 5/4 ... 11/4"), so every touch after the first captured a single
    frame and competed against touch 1's stale winner; a mid-touch read
    error could also resubmit that stale winner via the best_frame_no > 0
    fallback;
(b) the pre-existing reset hygiene sites (claim, SSM completion, scan start,
    deactivate, suspend, both enroll rejection paths) are all still present;
(c) the contrast gain is NOT part of this fix: ticket 78 falsified gain as
    the live cause ("do NOT re-litigate"), and the native normalization
    harness pins gain-1.0 values.
